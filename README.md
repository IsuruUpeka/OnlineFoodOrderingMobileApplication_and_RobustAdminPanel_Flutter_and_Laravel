The project includes the creation of a mobile app with the Flutter framework and Dart language, as well as an admin dashboard with the Laravel framework and PHP. MySQL is the database management system of choice.

## Getting Started

This GitHub repository contains a final project in Software Engineering that includes a mobile app built with the Flutter framework and Dart language, as well as an admin dashboard built with the Laravel framework and PHP. MySQL is the database management system used in this project.

Users can perform various tasks and access relevant information through the mobile app's intuitive and user-friendly interface. It makes use of the capabilities of Flutter and Dart to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

The admin dashboard built with Laravel and PHP, on the other hand, provides advanced functionality and control for administrators. It allows them to efficiently manage user accounts, monitor app activity, generate reports, and perform administrative tasks.

MySQL is used as the database system for the project to store and retrieve data for both the mobile app and the admin dashboard, ensuring data integrity and efficient data management.

This repository provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for developing a mobile app and admin dashboard with Flutter, Dart, Laravel, PHP, and MySQL, laying the groundwork for future development and customization.
